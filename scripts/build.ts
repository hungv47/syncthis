// Produces the published artifact: a single self-contained, Node-runnable bundle.
//
// syncthis is written in TypeScript and run directly by Bun in development
// (`bun bin/syncthis.ts`). For distribution we bundle everything — all runtime
// deps inlined — into dist/syncthis.mjs and rewrite the shebang to `node`, so
// `npx @hungv47/syncthis` works for any Node >=18 user without Bun installed and
// without installing a single transitive dependency. The runtime deps therefore
// live in devDependencies; they're compiled in here, not shipped as node_modules.
